## AI Prompting Reflection

Developing the **WeatherWise Advisor** app for the "Business Programming" unit was enhanced by AI tools. My goal was to use AI to build a functional weather app with real-world APIs and Python skills from the course.

### Tools Used
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Main tool for code generation, debugging, and app structure.
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: Used for refining visualization logic and natural language queries.

### How I Used AI
- **Code Generation**: Claude drafted functions like `get_weather_data()` for API calls with prompts like, "Write a Python function to fetch weather data using requests."
- **Debugging**: Claude explained errors (e.g., `KeyError` in API JSON) when prompted with, "Why am I getting a KeyError for 'rain' in this data?"
- **Module Design**: Claude helped with pseudocode via prompts like, "Outline pseudocode for a weather app with a menu system."
- **Dependencies**: Claude guided setup with, "How do I install dependencies in a virtual environment?"
- **Input Handling**: Improved robustness with Claudeâ€™s advice on, "How to handle invalid menu inputs safely?"
- **Visualizations**: ChatGPT refined charts with, "How to create a bar chart for temperature ranges?"

### Challenges Faced
- **Over-Reliance**: Initially accepted code without understanding; overcame by asking for explanations (e.g., "Explain this forecast loop").
- **Inconsistent Suggestions**: Some AI responses were generic; learned to use specific prompts with code snippets.
- **Prompt Precision**: Improved from vague to detailed prompts for better debugging help.

### Learning Outcomes
- **Python Skills**: Deepened understanding of loops, conditionals, and functions via AI explanations.
- **API Integration**: Learned to handle JSON and errors with OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Visualization**: Mastered plotting with `matplotlib` for temperature and precipitation charts.
- **Debugging**: Gained problem-solving skills by analyzing AI-suggested fixes.
- **Prompting**: Learned to craft precise prompts for effective AI assistance.

### Impact on Project
- **Efficiency**: AI sped up coding with quick drafts and solutions.
- **Robustness**: Error handling suggestions improved app reliability.
- **Completeness**: Implemented all features (weather data, queries, charts) with AI help.

### Conclusion
This project shows how AI prompting supports learning and code quality when used as a tutor. Claude was key for coding and debugging, while ChatGPT aided specific features. Challenges taught me critical evaluation, boosting my confidence in Python, APIs, and problem-solving for future projects.
