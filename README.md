# 🌤️ WeatherWise Advisor – AI-Assisted Python Weather App

This is a Python-based terminal application that allows users to:
- Check current weather conditions
- View multi-day forecasts
- Ask natural language weather questions
- See visual summaries of temperature, rain, and wind data

The app uses real-time data from OpenWeatherMap and was built using a combination of manual coding and AI collaboration (ChatGPT + Claude).
